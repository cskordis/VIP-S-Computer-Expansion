# VIP-S-Computer-Expansion
Expansion I/O board for the VIP-S Computer


### Please note that if the VP-590 Color board is used, U15 (CDP1861 Pixie) and U2 (CD4013 clock divider) must be removed from the VIP-S, as the Color board already contains the Pixie and clock circuitry that provides the 1.79 MHz clock to the VIP-S.
